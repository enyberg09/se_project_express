# WTWR (What to Wear?) — Back End

This is the back-end server for the **WTWR (What to Wear?)** application.

It handles the API, database, and user authorization logic for managing clothing items and user actions like liking or unliking items.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

The back-end focuses on:

- Building an Express.js server
- Working with MongoDB using Mongoose
- Setting up API endpoints for CRUD operations
- Implementing user interactions like likes/unlikes
- Handling validation and errors properly
- Preparing the server for deployment on a remote machine

---

## 🚀 Running the Project Locally

1. **Install MongoDB** on your machine if you don't already have it.
2. **Start the MongoDB service** so the server can connect to the database. (The database and collections will be created automatically when you first use the API)
3. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. **For production mode**

   ```bash
   npm run start
   ```

5. **For development mode (with nodemon)**

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
